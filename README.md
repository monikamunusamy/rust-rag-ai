# 🦀 Rust RAG AI

## 🤖 Minimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Rust

This project demonstrates how to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system completely in **Rust**, powered by **OpenAI** or **Hugging Face** models.  

The idea is simple:  
📚 Store documents → 🔍 Retrieve the most relevant chunks → 💬 Get AI-powered answers.

## ✨ Why this project?
- 🦀 100% **Rust-based** with async/await  
- 📂 Works with your own **documents**  
- ⚡ Fast & lightweight RAG pipeline  
- 🔑 Easy to extend into **chatbots**, **APIs**, or **research tools**
